# Yes. I know Markdown

As a first blog post, this is straight buisness.  Most of this is from the boilerplate, which I am keeping to remember how to set up a post.
To make more posts I will need to use the below format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.markdown`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `markdown` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, I will need to include some front matter included in this blog. 

Jekyll uses some features that Markdown does not have out of the box. Testing one of these below:

{% highlight python %}
def pythonCode(foo):
  bar = "hi, "+foo
  return bar
print(pythonCode('Tom'))
#=> reutrns 'hi, Tom' to sys.stdout
{% endhighlight %}

# Next Steps

I am still setting up this github page, and it may take another couple days to wrap up. Once it is done I have a few projects in mind I will spin up and begin blogging on.
